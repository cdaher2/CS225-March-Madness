1. After account is deleted the user is able to log back in using the same credentials, but the user file is deleted and the program has issues

2. Possible source of "null.ser(access denied)" exception discovered: when the user finalizes, logs out and then logs in, a duplicate user file called "null.ser" is created

3. Clear button should be greyed out in full map view

4. Delete account button should be greyed out in help view

5. Start up the program on help menu
	
6.reset button should be greyed on individual bracket

7.delete account should be moved to logout screen

8.Add buttons to a collection of some kind (arraylist, group)

9.User credentials should be cleared from login screen after logging out** (Joe as add on) other software may not do this(depending on the software)

10..dynamically resize buttons to window resize(FIXED, not implemented)

1) Also found #1

2) There should also be a total number of characters needed for the username:) (User can create usernames with length of 1 character XD)

3) The blue lines in the full bracket do not fit nicely with all of the team names(New Mexico St.).

4) Still do not see the scores of each team after finalization(Probably needed another week for this anyway:))

5) Multiple finalizing creates multiples of the user in the scoreboard.(Finalize it three times you see each user three times in scoreboard(copies of user))

6) Can create user's with the same password(Probably not super secure:O)

7) Should have the division buttons replicate the US map (East be in the east, South be directly south, ect.)

8) Buttons are not placed in one area.

9) The brackets do not resize with the window.

11. The logout button isn't greyed out in the login menu, this was fixed by me, but another commit seems to have broken it again. (Vrej)

1. Currently when the window resizes the buttons resizes along with the window.(This is not a bug, and was an intented feature.)

	1. Password should not except spaces 
	
	2. Unable to get out of help page
	
	3. if user logs out in help page, the delete account and log button will be the only things not grayed out if they log back in or create a new account
	
	4. Password should not remain when user logs out
	
	5. Simulating the bracket should remove all account and the button should tell the user the round will end if they simulate

	1- When you click the help button there is no exit button which the only option available is to logout. After logging out and then logging back in most of the buttons are grayed out. The only buttons that are visible is the “Logout and Delete Account” buttons. This present a problem because I can’t either choose a division or finalize the bracket. To fix this issue I have to quit the program and rerun it again. Not fun.

	2- Hitting the “Clear” button in any division automatically erases everything without asking a confirmation to the user. It can be frustrating. 

	3- Delete button is not working properly. When you delete an account it does not bring you to the home screen.

1. On the HELP dialog there is an EXIT button, but only the top portion of that is displayed. When the window is small there is no way to view the help text and EXIT button on the HELP dialog. There should be scroll bars.
2. I also found some of the bugs mentioned above.

1. Logout button should be greyed out at the sign in screen.
2. Unable to view the whole screen content after resizing the window to samller size, a scroll bar would be a good idea. Note, this doesn't happen in full map or in a division.
3.Also found #1-7 and 9

1. Finalizing a bracket will duplicate all scoreboard results and reduce their scores
2. I also found the bug noted by others involving the HELP menu greying out all but two options until the application is restarted

1. If your username is too long, the program will give you an error message that it cannot save your name

2.  Delete account button is still next to finalize and choose division

3. The full bracket does not fit on a single page

4. You can still login after you delete the account

5.  The help screen does not use the same toolbar as the other screens

6.  If you create a bracket, reset or clear it and log out, it does not save the fact that you cleared the bracket.  The bracket is still there
